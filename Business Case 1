Sunday and Saturday are the two days during the week that experience the highest hours for bike rentals.
I want to tailor marketing campaigns that will promote bike rentals during peak hour. 
This will raise sales even more during peak hours. 
For hours that are not as common for bike rentals, I think that a marketing strategy of offering promotions, discounts, or loyalty programs 
to encourage people to rent bikes during the off-peak hours will help balance the demand for bike rentals and make revenue more split between 
all days of the week.  
Capitalizing on the high-demand periods through additional promotions and services will create more of a balance overall.
