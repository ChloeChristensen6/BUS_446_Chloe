Sunday and Saturday (the weekend) were the highest for bike rentals. 
The lowest was Monday, which makes sense because people are working during the week. 
Increasing the demand for bike rentals during the weekdays will help revenues. 
People tend to not use the bike rentals as often during the week, and because of that I can infer that the bike rentals might not 
be as convenient to people during the busy times, being the weekdays. Making the bike rentals more useful during the week will help with efficiency and convenience. 
For Sundays and Saturdays, it is important to continue bike rentals on these days and make sure that everything is 
perfected in order to get people to start using them on the weekdays as well.
