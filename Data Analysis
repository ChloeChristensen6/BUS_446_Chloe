The objective of my question was to find the peak hours on what days that the citi bike rentals are being used the most and at what times. 
To find this, I collected the historical data on bike rentals in the city and its information on date, time, and duration of each rental. 
Then I cleaned the data and fix the missing values and inconsistencies. 
After that, I inputted all of my data into R and from there, I created a bar graph to represent all of my findings on the data. 
To do so, I arranged my data into columns of weekday and usage (hours) to find when the peak hours for rentals were.
I did this to make my data more readable for others to understand. 
I then coded to change the colors, position, and titles of my graph to make it look better.
