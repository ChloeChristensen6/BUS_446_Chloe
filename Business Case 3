A strategy that can help reduce the use of costs for bike rentals is to make sure I am allocating my resources in a beneficial way. 
Since most of the weekdays are not as popular, lowering the number of bikes available on the not so common days will help reduce additional costs.
Also implementing additional staff or utilizing technology for when there are issues can help in the more predictive peak hours. 
Along with the technology, a marketing strategy to increase revenues would be to make promotion campaigns that will stream during the peak hours of the day and bike rental times.
